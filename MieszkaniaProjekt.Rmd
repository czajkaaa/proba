## GitHub Documents

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:
#NASZE KODY
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
dane <- apartments_rent_pl_2024_06

library(mice, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
```




```{r}
md.pattern(dane)

library(dplyr)
dane <- dane %>% select(-id)

imputed <- mice(dane, m = 5, method = 'pmm', seed = 123)
completed_data <- complete(imputed, 1)
View(completed_data)

md.pattern(completed_data)


```


```{r}
#Stripplot for imputed data
stripplot(imputed, pch = 20, cex = 1.2)

```

#ggmice
